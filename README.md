# Dash
Hanzo's dashboard is designed for use by developers, support members and
executives of a given organization. Ideally all marketing and most of the
support operations can be performed via it.

The dashboard is composed of modules, each representing an orthogonal collection
of features. Each module contains a set of views which are typically accessible
from the dashboard sidebar. Each module can be used independently of each other,
but frequently modules extend functionality in other modules.

# Goals

## For us
- Adding new views and modules should be straightforward
- Consistent layout / organization
- Composable, reusable views and widgets
- Optimized development process and rapid iteration
- Onboarding new organizations should be fast and straight-forward
- Should streamline marketing efforts we perform

## For organizations
- Access to real-time ecommerce statistics
- Analytics/Reporting (mostly powered by GoodData)
- Ecommerce support functionality
- Able to edit orders
- Interact with customers
- Send marketing emails
- Resend order confirmations
- Credit accounts, etc.
- Flexible enough to support diverse needs
- Provide support for launching, growing and maintaining commerce-driven companies
- Analytics integrations
- Authentication / User management
- Ecommerce / Order management
- Marketing APIs / customer interaction
- Easy to navigate and discover functionality / features
- Ability to configure integrations with third-party services
- New organizations need fewer features, expect functionality used to grow over time
